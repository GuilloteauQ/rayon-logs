- colors: use work to compute rectangles opacity (could we also use surface area ?)
- text labels on tasks : we need to provide a labeled join and a labeled iterator
- add some genericity in logger to provides logging hooks

--- minor:
- we can maybe rewrite TaskLog creator to avoid completing an array since we are in order now
- impl tree scan to avoid passing mutable slices everywhere and all extra vector copies in fork_join
