--- minor:
- we can maybe rewrite TaskLog creator to avoid completing an array since we are in order now
- impl tree scan to avoid passing mutable slices everywhere and all extra vector copies in fork_join
- add some genericity in logger to provides logging hooks
- histograms are highly unstable for merge sort with sequential merge ??????
- are fully inactive threads also displayed in idle times ?

--- more important:
- change colors: don't take min speed but smooth it (remove too exreme points ?, take work into account ?)
    -> right now it just takes one good very small point to get dark colors everywhere

- log viewer in opengl (to avoind the slow javascript and html animation "bugs" (if too small, not run))
- move more of rayon into rayon-logs : par_split ?
- rethink the iterator interface : should we log on inner most or outer most level ?
- have an option to not display iterators like special tasks
