- in case of join it would be nice to have : task1 displayed on the left and task2 on the right
---> i'm not sure it is the case right now because I think we go by starting times

- redo examples and html web page
  github is filtering a lot, what to do about it ?

--- minor:
- we can maybe rewrite TaskLog creator to avoid completing an array since we are in order now
- impl tree scan to avoid passing mutable slices everywhere and all extra vector copies in fork_join
- text labels on tasks : we need to provide a labeled join and a labeled iterator
- add some genericity in logger to provides logging hooks
- histograms are highly unstable for merge sort with sequential merge ??????
- check why iterators advance contiguously
- remove visualize function and add method to runlog
