- provide a rayon-logs::join with a lazy-static pool
- colors: we need to sum times in all sequential blocks
- leaves have high speed variations: maybe taking the best speed for color is not the best idea
- check why iterators advance contiguously
- text labels on tasks : we need to provide a labeled join and a labeled iterator
- add some genericity in logger to provides logging hooks

--- minor:
- we can maybe rewrite TaskLog creator to avoid completing an array since we are in order now
- impl tree scan to avoid passing mutable slices everywhere and all extra vector copies in fork_join
